##To-Do's
* ~~Differentiate between Active Time & Paused time in Shifts~~
* ~~Determine a way to store multiple trips in localStorage~~
* Finish full trip
  * ~~Break down Active Trips vs Completed Trips component logic~~ 
  * ~~Build TimeStamp for Ending Trip~~
  * ~~EndTrip Link Logic still needs built~~ (Works, but seems like it needs to be better)
  * Build in info Stamping for trips that are running simultaneously.
  * Multi-Stamp bug seems to reset the stamp upon refresh of screen. Trips, is also behind trip when saving to localStorage.
